# Requirements
```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

[`ckan-docker`](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker) consists of a set of containers deploy with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`docker compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Prerequisites
### docker compose *vs* docker-compose
All Docker Compose commands in this document will use the V2 version of Compose ie: `docker compose`. The older version (V1) used the `docker-compose` command. Please see [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/) for
more information.

### Install docker-engine
Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your environment to install Docker Engine.

To verify a successful Docker installation, run `docker run hello-world` and `docker version`. These commands should output 
versions for client and server.
