## Debugging
### Debugging CKAN Development Instance with VSCode Dev Containers and debugpy

The [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) extension is a powerful tool that enables developers to use a container as a complete development environment. With this extension, developers can open any folder inside a container and take advantage of the full range of features provided by Visual Studio Code. To do this, developers create a `devcontainer.json `file in their project that specifies how to access or create a development container with a predefined tool and runtime stack. This allows developers to work in an isolated environment, ensuring that the development environment is consistent across team members and that project dependencies are easy to manage.

![Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/devcontainers/containers/architecture-containers.png)

To set this up:

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Install the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) for VSCode.

3. In your project directory, create a `devcontainer.json` file. This file will contain the configuration for your development container.

4. In the `devcontainer.json` file, specify the Docker image for your development container and any additional configuration settings, such as environment variables, ports to expose, and startup commands.

5. Enable `debugpy` for your development instance in your `.env` file:

  ```ini
  USE_DEBUGPY_FOR_DEV=true
  ```

6. Start the containers in [development mode](#development-mode) and launch VS Code.

7. Install the "Dev Container" extension: press `CTRL+SHIFT+X`, type "dev container", click "install".

8. Click the `Open a Remote Window` button in the bottom-left of the VS Code window.

9. Click `Attach to Running Container...` and select your ckan-dev container, e.g. `ckan-docker-ckan-dev-1`.

10. Click the `Run and Debug` icon on the left panel then `create a launch.json`, select `Python Debugger`, `Remote Attach`, host `localhost` and port `5678`.

11. Press `F5` or click the `Run` menu and `Start Debugging`.

You can now set breakpoints and remote debug your CKAN development instance using VSCode Dev Containers and debugpy.

### pdb
Add these lines to the `ckan-dev` service in the docker compose.dev.yml file

```yaml
ports:
  - "0.0.0.0:${CKAN_PORT}:5000"

stdin_open: true
tty: true
```

Debug with pdb (example) - Interact with `docker attach $(docker container ls -qf name=ckan)`

command: `python -m pdb /usr/lib/ckan/venv/bin/ckan --config /srv/app/ckan.ini run --host 0.0.0.0 --passthrough-errors`


## Reverse proxy
### NGINX
The default Docker Compose configuration ([`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)) uses an NGINX image as the front-end (ie: reverse proxy). It includes HTTPS running on port number 8443 and an HTTP port (81). A "self-signed" SSL certificate is generated beforehand and the server certificate and key files are included. The NGINX `server_name` (ENV: `PROXY_SERVER_NAME`) directive and the `CN` field in the SSL certificate have been both set to 'localhost'. This should obviously not be used for production.

The proxy locations, ports and other NGINX options can be modified in the `.env` file:
```ini
# Host Ports
NGINX_PORT_HOST=81
NGINX_SSLPORT_HOST=8443

# NGINX
NGINX_PORT=80
NGINX_SSLPORT=443
NGINX_LOG_DIR=/var/log/nginx

# Check CKAN__ROOT_PATH and CKANEXT__DCAT__BASE_URI. If you don't need to use domain locations, it is better to use the nginx configuration. Leave blank or use the root `/`.
PROXY_SERVER_NAME=localhost
PROXY_CKAN_LOCATION=/catalog
PROXY_PYCSW_LOCATION=/csw
```
The base Docker Compose configuration uses an NGINX image as the front-end (ie: reverse proxy). It includes HTTPS running on port number 8443. A "self-signed" SSL certificate is generated as part of the ENTRYPOINT. The ENV `PROXY_SERVER_NAME`, NGINX `server_name` directive and the `CN` field in the SSL certificate have been both set to 'localhost'. This should obviously not be used for production.

Creating the SSL cert and key files as follows:
`openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=DE/ST=Berlin/L=Berlin/O=None/CN=localhost" -keyout ckan-local.key -out ckan-local.crt`
The `ckan-local.*` files will then need to be moved into the nginx/setup/ directory


### Apache HTTP Server
The Docker Compose configuration ([`docker-compose.apache.yml`](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.apache.yml)) uses an httpd image as the front-end. It has two routes for the ckan (default location: `/catalog`) and ckan-pycsw (default location: `/csw`) services. 

The proxy locations, ports and other Apache Web Server options can be modified in the `.env` file:
```ini
# Host Ports
APACHE_PORT_HOST=81

# Apache HTTP Server
APACHE_VERSION=2.4-alpine
APACHE_PORT=80
APACHE_LOG_DIR=/var/log/apache

# Check CKAN__ROOT_PATH and CKANEXT__DCAT__BASE_URI. If you don't need to use domain locations, it is better to use the nginx configuration. Leave blank or use the root `/`.
PROXY_SERVER_NAME=localhost
PROXY_CKAN_LOCATION=/catalog
PROXY_PYCSW_LOCATION=/csw
```


## envvars
The ckanext-envvars extension is used in the CKAN Docker base repo to build the base images.
This extension checks for environmental variables conforming to an expected format and updates the corresponding CKAN config settings with its value.

For the extension to correctly identify which env var keys map to the format used for the config object, env var keys should be formatted in the following way:

  All uppercase  
  Replace periods ('.') with two underscores ('__')  
  Keys must begin with 'CKAN' or 'CKANEXT', if they do not you can prepend them with '`CKAN___`' 

For example:

  * `CKAN__PLUGINS="envvars image_view text_view recline_view datastore datapusher"`
  * `CKAN__DATAPUSHER__CALLBACK_URL_BASE=http://ckan:5000`
  * `CKAN___BEAKER__SESSION__SECRET=CHANGE_ME`

These parameters can be added to the `.env` file 

For more information please see [ckanext-envvars](https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-envvars)


## Datastore
The Datastore database and user is created as part of the entrypoint scripts for the db container.

## xloader
This deployment replaces DataPusher with XLoader using Supervisor, more info about other alternatives on the wiki page for this: https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker/wiki/Replacing-DataPusher-with-XLoader

## ckan-pycsw
[ckan-pycsw](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-pycsw) is a docker compose environment (based on [pycsw](https://github.com/geopython/pycsw)) for development and testing with CKAN Open Data portals.

Available components:
* **pycsw**: The pycsw app. An [OARec](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/records) and [OGC CSW](https://opengeospatial.org/standards/cat) server implementation written in Python.
* **ckan2pycsw**: Software to achieve interoperability with the open data portals based on CKAN. To do this, ckan2pycsw reads data from an instance using the CKAN API, generates ISO-19115/ISO-19139 metadata using [pygeometa](https://geopython.github.io/pygeometa/), or a custom schema that is based on a customized CKAN schema, and populates a [pycsw](https://pycsw.org/) instance that exposes the metadata using CSW and OAI-PMH.

## Harvester consumers on a deployed CKAN
[ckanext-harvest supervisor](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-harvest#setting-up-the-harvesters-on-a-production-server) allows you to harvest metadata from multiple sources on a production deployment. Here it is deployed [by a worker consumers in the `ckan` container](./ckan/setup/workers/harvester.conf), also the `ckanext-harvest` extension and other custom harvesters ([`ckanext-schemingdcat`](https://github.com/mjanez/ckanext-schemingdcat?tab=readme-ov-file#harvesters) or [`ckanext-dcat`](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat#rdf-dcat-harvester)) are included in the CKAN docker images.

:::tip
To enable harvesters you need to set up in the `.env` file the `CKAN__PLUGINS` variable with the `harvest` plugin: https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker/blob/a18e0c80d9f16b6d9b6471e3148d48fcb83712bd/.env.example#L126-L127

### CKAN. Backups
PostgreSQL offers the command line tools [`pg_dump`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgdump.html) and [`pg_restore`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgrestore.html) for dumping and restoring a database and its content to/from a file.


#### Backup service for db container
1. Create a new file called `ckan_backup_custom.sh` and open it in your preferred text editor.

2. Add the following code to the script, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Set the necessary variables
    CONTAINER_NAME="db"
    DATABASE_NAME="ckandb"
    POSTGRES_USER="postgres"
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD="your_postgres_password"
    BACKUP_DIRECTORY="/path/to/your/backup/directory"
    DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
    MONTH=$(date +%m)
    YEAR=$(date +%Y)

    # Create the monthly backup directory if it doesn't exist
    mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIRECTORY/monthly/$YEAR-$MONTH"

    # Run the backup command
    docker exec -e PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD $CONTAINER_NAME pg_dump -U $POSTGRES_USER -Fc $DATABASE_NAME > "$BACKUP_DIRECTORY/monthly/$YEAR-$MONTH/ckan_backup_$DATE.dump"

    # Compress the dump files into a zip archive
    cd "$BACKUP_DIRECTORY/monthly/$YEAR-$MONTH" || exit
    zip "backup_${YEAR}-${MONTH}.zip" *.dump

    # Remove the original dump files
    rm -f *.dump
    ```

3. Replace the following placeholders with your actual values:
    - `your_postgres_password`: The password for the PostgreSQL user.
    - `/path/to/your/backup/directory`: The path to the directory where you want to store the backup files.

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you have changed the values of the PostgreSQL container, database or user, change them too.
    > Check that `zip` package is installed: `sudo apt-get install zip`

4. Save and close the file.

5. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ckan_backup_custom.sh
    ```

6. Open the crontab for the current user:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

7. Add the following line to schedule the backup to run daily at midnight (adjust the schedule as needed):

    ```sh
    0 0 * * * /path/to/your/script/ckan_backup_custom.sh
    ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > Replace `/path/to/your/script` with the actual path to the `ckan_backup_custom.sh` script.
  
8. Save and close the file.

The cronjob is now set up and will backup your CKAN PostgreSQL database daily at midnight using the custom format. The backups will be stored in the specified directory with the timestamp in the filename.

> [!NOTE]
> Sample scripts for backing up CKAN: [`doc/scripts`](doc/scripts)


#### Restore a backup
If need to use a backup, restore it:

1. First clean the database. **Caution, this will delete all data from your CKAN database!**

    ```bash
    docker exec -it ckan /bin/bash -c "export TERM=xterm; exec bash"

    # Delete everything in the CKAN database, including the tables, to start from scratch
    ckan -c $CKAN_INI db clean
    ```

2. After cleaning the database you must do either [initialize it](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/database-management.html#initialization) or import a previously created dump.

    ```bash
    docker exec -i -e PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD $POSTGRESQL_CONTAINER_NAME pg_restore -U $POSTGRES_USER --clean --if-exists -d $DATABASE_NAME < /path/to/your/backup/directory/ckan.dump
    ```
3. Restart the `ckan` container.


### CKAN. Manage new users
1. Create a new user from the Docker host, for example to create a new user called `user_example`

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container-id> ckan -c ckan.ini user add user_example email=user_example@localhost

   # Admin user
   docker exec -it <container-id> ckan -c ckan.ini sysadmin add admin_example email=admin_example@localhost name=admin_example
    ```

   To delete the 'user_example' user

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container-id> ckan -c ckan.ini user remove user_example`
    ```

1. Create a new user from within the ckan container. You will need to get a session on the running container

   ```bash
   ckan -c ckan.ini user add user_example email=user_example@localhost`
    ```

   To delete the 'user_example' user
   ```bash
   ckan -c ckan.ini user remove user_example`
    ```

### Docker Compose. Configure a docker compose service to start on boot
To have Docker Compose run automatically when you reboot a machine, you can follow the steps below:
1. Create a systemd service file for Docker Compose. You can create a file named `ckan-docker-compose.service` in the `/etc/systemd/system/` folder with the following content:

    ```bash
    [Unit]
    Description=CKAN Docker Compose Application Service
    Requires=docker.service
    After=docker.service

    [Service]
    User=docker
    Group=docker
    Type=oneshot
    RemainAfterExit=yes
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/project/ckan-docker/
    ExecStart=/bin/docker compose up -d
    ExecStop=/bin/docker compose down
    TimeoutStartSec=0

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

2. Replace `/path/to/project/ckan-docker/` with the path where your project's `docker-compose.yml` file is located and and check the path to the docker compose binary on execution and stop: `/bin/docker`. Also change the `User` / `Group` to execute the service.
3. Load the systemd service file with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

4. Enables the service to start automatically when the machine boots up:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable ckan-docker-compose
    ```

5. You can now start the service with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start ckan-docker-compose
    ```

6. If you want to stop or check the status of the service, use the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Stop the service
    sudo systemctl stop ckan-docker-compose

    # Check the status
    sudo systemctl status ckan-docker-compose
    ```
