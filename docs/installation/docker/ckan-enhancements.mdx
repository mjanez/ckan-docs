## CKAN images
![CKAN Docker Platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjanez/ckan-docker/master/doc/img/ckan-docker-images.png)

The Docker image config files used to build your CKAN project are located in the `ckan/` folder. There are two Docker files:

* `Dockerfile`: this is based on `mjanez/ckan-base-spatial:<version>`, a base image located in the [Github Package Registry](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker/pkgs/container/ckan-base-spatial), that has CKAN installed along with all its dependencies, properly configured and running on [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (production setup)
* `Dockerfile.dev`:  this is based on `mjanez/ckan-base-spatial:<version>-dev` also located located in the Github Package Registry, and extends `mjanez/ckan-base-spatial:<version>` to include:

  * Any extension cloned on the `./src` folder will be installed in the CKAN container when booting up Docker Compose (`docker compose up`). This includes installing any requirements listed in a `requirements.txt` (or `pip-requirements.txt`) file and running `python setup.py develop`.
  * CKAN is started running this: `/usr/bin/ckan -c /srv/app/ckan.ini run -H 0.0.0.0`.
  * Make sure to add the local plugins to the `CKAN__PLUGINS` env var in the `.env` file.

* Any custom changes to the scripts run during container start up can be made to scripts in the `setup/` directory. For instance if you wanted to change the port on which CKAN runs you would need to make changes to the Docker Compose yaml file, and the `start_ckan.sh.override` file. Then you would need to add the following line to the Dockerfile ie: `COPY setup/start_ckan.sh.override ${APP_DIR}/start_ckan.sh`. The `start_ckan.sh` file in the locally built image would override the `start_ckan.sh` file included in the base image

:::tip 
 If you get an error like ` doesn't have execute permissions`: 

```log
Daemon error response: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: "/srv/app/start_ckan.sh": permission denied: unknown
```

It may be necessary to give execute permissions to the file in the `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
...
# Override start_ckan.sh
COPY setup/start_ckan.sh.override ${APP_DIR}/start_ckan.sh
RUN chmod +x ${APP_DIR}/start_ckan.sh
...
```

### Extending the base images
You can modify the docker files to build your own customized image tailored to your project, installing any extensions and extra requirements needed. For example here is where you would update to use a different CKAN base image ie: `ckan/ckan-base-spatial:<new version>`

To perform extra initialization steps you can add scripts to your custom images and copy them to the `/docker-entrypoint.d` folder (The folder should be created for you when you build the image). Any `*.sh` and `*.py` file in that folder will be executed just after the main initialization script ([`prerun.py`](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base/blob/main/ckan-2.9/base/setup/prerun.py)) is executed and just before the web server and supervisor processes are started.

For instance, consider the following custom image:

```bash
ckan
├── docker-entrypoint.d
│   └── setup_validation.sh
├── Dockerfile
└── Dockerfile.dev
```

We want to install an extension like [ckanext-validation](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/ckanext-validation) that needs to create database tables on startup time. We create a `setup_validation.sh` script in a `docker-entrypoint.d` folder with the necessary commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create DB tables if not there
ckan -c /srv/app/ckan.ini validation init-db 
```

And then in our `Dockerfile.dev` file we install the extension and copy the initialization scripts:

```dockerfile
FROM ckan/ckan-base-spatial:2.9.11

RUN pip install -e git+https://github.com/frictionlessdata/ckanext-validation.git#egg=ckanext-validation && \
    pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frictionlessdata/ckanext-validation/master/requirements.txt

COPY docker-entrypoint.d/* /docker-entrypoint.d/
```
:::tip
There are a number of extension examples commented out in the [`Dockerfile.dev`](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker/blob/master/ckan/Dockerfile.dev) file

### Applying patches
When building your project specific CKAN images (the ones defined in the `ckan/` folder), you can apply patches 
to CKAN core or any of the built extensions. To do so create a folder inside `ckan/patches` with the name of the
package to patch (ie `ckan` or `ckanext-??`). Inside you can place patch files that will be applied when building
the images. The patches will be applied in alphabetical order, so you can prefix them sequentially if necessary.

For instance, check the following example image folder:

```bash
ckan
├── patches
│   ├── ckan
│   │   ├── 01_datasets_per_page.patch
│   │   ├── 02_groups_per_page.patch
│   │   ├── 03_or_filters.patch
│   └── ckanext-harvest
│       └── 01_resubmit_objects.patch
├── setup
├── Dockerfile
└── Dockerfile.dev
```

:::info
Git diff is a command to output the changes between two sources inside the Git repository. The data sources can be two different branches, commits, files, etc.
* Show changes between working directory and staging area:
   ```bash
   git diff > [file.patch]
   ```
* Shows any changes between the staging area and the repository:
  ```bash
  git diff --staged [file]`
  ```
:::

### Applying patches in dev mode
To apply patches in development mode, you would need to follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your patches are placed in the `ckan/patches` directory. The patches should be organized into subdirectories named after the package they are intended to patch (e.g., `ckan` or `ckanext-??`). Each patch file should end with the .patch extension.

    For example, your directory structure might look like this:

    ```bash
    ckan
    ├── patches
    │   ├── ckan
    │   │   ├── 01_datasets_per_page.patch
    │   │   ├── 02_groups_per_page.patch
    │   │   ├── 03_or_filters.patch
    │   └── ckanext-harvest
    │       └── 01_resubmit_objects.patch
    ├── setup
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── Dockerfile.dev
    ```

2. Navigate to the `/src` directory.

3. Apply the patches using the patch command:

    ```bash
    find /path/to/ckan/patches -name '*.patch' -exec patch -p1 < {} \;
    ```

    This command will recursively search the `/path/to/ckan/patches` directory for files ending with `.patch` and apply them using the patch command. Replace `/path/to/ckan/patches` with the actual path to your `ckan/patches` directory.

## Create an extension in development mode
You can use the ckan [extension](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/tutorial.html#creating-a-new-extension) instructions to create a CKAN extension, only executing the command inside the CKAN container and setting the mounted `src/` folder as output:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ckan-dev /bin/sh -c "ckan -c /srv/app/ckan.ini generate extension --output-dir /srv/app/src_extensions"
  ```

Then, answer the prompts to configure the plugin:

  ```bash
  Extension's name [must begin 'ckanext-']: ckanext-newextension
  Author's name []: Joe Bloggs
  Author's email []: joe@bloggs.com
  Your Github user or organization name []: joebloggs
  Brief description of the project []: test creating a new extension
  List of keywords (separated by spaces) [CKAN]: ckanext-newextension
  Do you want to include code examples? [y/N]: y
  
  Written: /srv/app/src_extensions/ckanext-newextension
  ```

The new extension files and directories are created in the `/srv/app/src_extensions/` folder in the running container. They will also exist in the local src/ directory as local `/src` directory is mounted as `/srv/app/src_extensions/` on the ckan container. You might need to change the owner of its folder to have the appropiate permissions.
