:::tip

:::

## Requirements {#requirements}

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Scaffold project website {#scaffold-project-website}

The easiest way to install Docusaurus is to use the command line tool that helps you scaffold a skeleton Docusaurus website. You can run this command anywhere in a new empty repository or within an existing repository, it will create a new directory containing the scaffolded files.

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

We recommend the `classic` template so that you can get started quickly, and it contains features found in Docusaurus 1. The `classic` template contains `@docusaurus/preset-classic` which includes standard documentation, a blog, custom pages, and a CSS framework (with dark mode support). You can get up and running extremely quickly with the classic template and customize things later on when you have gained more familiarity with Docusaurus.

You can also use the template's TypeScript variant by passing the `--typescript` flag. See [TypeScript support](./typescript-support.mdx) for more information.

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic --typescript
```

:::info Meta-Only

If you are setting up a new Docusaurus website for a Meta open source project, run this command inside an internal repository, which comes with some useful Meta-specific defaults:

```bash
scarf static-docs-bootstrap
```
