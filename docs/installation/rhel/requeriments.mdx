# Requeriments and dependencies

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

## Prerequisites: {#prerequisites}
Before installing CKAN, ensure you have at least the following prerequisites in place:

* [RHEL 9.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.3_release_notes/overview) installed and configured.
* [Python 3.9](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/es-es/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/installing_and_using_dynamic_programming_languages/assembly_installing-and-using-python_installing-and-using-dynamic-programming-languages) or later installed.


##  System Preparation: {#system-preparation}
Before installing CKAN, we need to prepare the system by installing some necessary packages. The following commands should be run as root.

First, we update the system packages:

```bash
dnf update -y
```

Then, we install some basic packages that are necessary for the installation and operation of CKAN:

```bash
dnf -y install sudo nano git wget gcc openssl-devel libffi-devel make automake cmake
```

These packages include tools for compiling code (like `gcc`), libraries for security (like `openssl-devel` and `libffi-devel`), and general utility tools (like `sudo`, `nano`, `git`, and `wget`).

## Python Dependencies Installation: {#python-dependencies-installation}
CKAN is a Python application, so we need to install Python and some Python libraries. We run the following commands to install Python, pip (a Python package manager), and `libpq` (a library needed to interact with PostgreSQL, the database that CKAN uses):

```bash
dnf -y install python3 python3-pip libpq
```

Finally, we install [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (a tool for creating Python virtual environments) and [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/introduction.html) (a tool for system configuration automation) with pip:

```bash	
pip3 install virtualenv
pip3 install ansible
```

With this, we have prepared the system for the installation of CKAN. In the following steps, we will proceed to install CKAN itself.
