# CKAN: Development

## CKAN code architecture
CKAN's code architecture is designed with specific coding standards in mind to maintain consistency with its intended design and architecture.

### Blueprints
CKAN is based on Flask and uses Blueprints. Default blueprints are defined along views in `ckan.views` and extended with the `ckan.plugins.interfaces.IBlueprint` plugin interface.

### Views
Views process requests by reading and updating data with action functions and return a response by rendering Jinja2 templates. CKAN views are defined in `ckan.views` and templates in `ckan.templates`.

### Template Helper Functions
Template helper functions are used for code that is reused frequently or code that is too complicated to be included in the templates themselves. They should never perform expensive queries or update data.

### Action Functions
Whenever some code wants to get, create, update or delete an object from CKAN's model it should do so by calling a function from the `ckan.logic.action` package, and *not* by accessing `ckan.model` directly.

### Logic
Logic includes action functions, auth functions, background tasks and business logic. Action functions have a uniform interface accepting a dictionary of simple strings lists, dictionaries or files. They return simple dictionaries or raise one of a small number of exceptions.

### Models
Ideally SQLAlchemy should only be used within `ckan.model` and not from other packages such as `ckan.logic`. 

### Deprecation
Anything that may be used by extensions, themes or API clients needs to maintain backward compatibility at call-site. To deprecate a function use the `ckan.lib.maintain.deprecated` decorator and add "deprecated" to the function's docstring.
