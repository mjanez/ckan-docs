# Documentation on DMS, CKAN, and DataHub

This repository contains comprehensive documentation on various aspects of Data Management Systems (DMS), CKAN, and DataHub (formerly known as portal.js). These documents provide valuable insights into the architecture, capabilities, and functionalities of these platforms. Below is an overview of each section:

## Data Management Systems (DMS)

A Data Management System (DMS) is a suite of tools and processes used to manage, organize, and store data. It encompasses data governance, data quality, data integration, and data security. Our documentation covers:

## CKAN

CKAN is a powerful open-source data management system that provides tools to streamline the process of publishing, sharing, and using data. The documentation includes detailed information about:

- **Introduction to CKAN**: An overview of CKAN and its key features.
- **CKAN Architecture**: Insights into the architectural design of CKAN, including its modular components.
- **Installation and Setup**: Step-by-step instructions to install and configure CKAN.
- **Customization and Extensions**: How to customize CKAN and extend its capabilities with plugins.
- **Use Cases**: Examples of how CKAN is used in various industries and organizations.

## DataHub (formerly portal.js)

DataHub is an open-source platform designed to make data management and publishing easy and accessible. Formerly known as portal.js, DataHub offers a modern approach to building data portals. The documentation covers:
